swag2pm
=======

This little script and class collection *should* generate [Postman](https://github.com/a85/POSTMan-Chrome-Extension/)
collections from [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec) api documentation feeds.

Example:

```
$ ./swag2pm.php
Usage: ./swag2pm.php <swagger source> <collection name>

$ ./swag2pm.php http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs petstore
Finished - wrote output to: ./petstore-postman.json
```

There are sample files included generated by this tool against the
Xirrus Management System and the Swagger petstore example.
You should be able to import these files direclty into Postman as new collections.
